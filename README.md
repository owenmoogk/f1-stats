# f1-stats
An f1 stats app, for all the hypotheticals...

### Update
This website used the [Ergast](http://ergast.com/) F1 API, which has since been deprecated. This unfortunately breaks the functionality. However, if there is another free API with the same standings data, I will modify the site to use that. If you are aware of such an API, please [contact me](https://owenmoogk.github.io/contact)!
